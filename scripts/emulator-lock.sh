# Shared script: sync-common keeps every repo's copy identical to the original in the tooling checkout; edit the original only.

# Runs a command holding this repo's emulator lock, so sessions that share the emulator take turns.
# Boots the emulator first and stops it after, since a quickboot costs seconds and an idle emulator costs RAM and battery.
# The command inherits the lock, so killing this script can't free it while the command still runs, and the OS drops it once both are gone.
# Usage: scripts/emulator-lock.sh <command> [args...]
#   e.g. scripts/emulator-lock.sh ./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
#   KEEP_EMULATOR=1 leaves the emulator running for device work that follows right away; scripts/emulator.sh stop stops it later
#   LOCK_WAIT_MINUTES (default 20) is how long to wait for another session's lock before failing; EMULATOR_LOCK overrides the lock path
#   IMAGE_TAG and HEADLESS pass through to scripts/emulator.sh
