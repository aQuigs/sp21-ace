# Shared rules for every repo

## Shared files

- Files headed `Shared script:`, `Shared workflow:`, `Shared config:` or `Shared rules:` are copies of files in a separate tooling checkout. `sync-common` overwrites them, matched by name. Edit them at the source, never here, and do not name a repo-owned file after a shared one. Merge a PR that only runs `sync-common` yourself once its checks pass.
- `sync-common` lists every shared file this repo has no copy of as `skipped`. When one fits the work at hand (a rule file for a platform the repo now targets, a script it now needs), adopt it as the line says: create it empty at the path shown and run `sync-common` again, or for a rule file, ask the user to.

## How we work

- Every change after the initial scaffold ships as a PR against `main`, using the PR template. Code changes get an adversarial-review pass and `/simplify` on the branch. Then, for code and docs alike, ask: can this be made meaningfully simpler without losing functionality? Generated docs run verbose, so they need the question as much as code. If so, make those changes before opening the PR. Only a trivial change, like a few words, skips it.
- A PR body gives the useful takeaways to a reviewer who knows the project but wasn't in the session: not a log of the work, and not prose. Every section, Details and output included, holds only what matters, most important first:
  - Choose points by importance and leave the rest out entirely. Length follows from the PR, not from a budget. A point isn't important because it is true or was verified; it is important when a reviewer without it would misread the change or miss a risk.
  - Each bullet is short, plain and complete in itself, with no follow-on explanation. A check states what it shows, such as "agrees with the exact figure within one standard error", not bare numbers. Code names, counts, precision and project notation appear only where the reader needs them.
  - Details: what the change does, its scope, and the key idea of how it works, and nothing else.
  - Decisions made: one bullet per choice a reviewer might have made differently, giving the choice and its reason or cost. Leave out how the design evolved, earlier drafts, and anything the diff or Details already shows.
  - Testing done: one bullet per check that shows the change works beyond what CI reports, such as on the device or against a reference figure, and one for what wasn't tested and why. Describe what the tests cover, not each test. A review finding belongs only as the reason for a decision, never as a narrated review round.
  - Output: only runs that show what the change does.
- A passing test is not a passing feature: for UI changes, run the app, screenshot, and look at the image before calling it done.
- User-visible changes carry screenshots (or a recording) in the PR's "Screenshots / recording" section:
  - Shoot every state the change touches, not one before and one after. Empty and filled, and before and after an action, are separate states. Light and dark theme are separate states only when the change is about colour or theming; otherwise one theme is enough.
  - Take the before shots on `main` and the after shots on the branch.
  - Publish with `scripts/pr-media.sh`, one caption per file, and paste its table as is, at most about four states. A screen that is new in the PR gets an after shot only.
  - Media is uploaded as GitHub attachments, never committed. Shots must never show a signed-in account.

## Conventions

- Comments explain *why*, never *what*. Self-evident code gets no comment.
- Commit messages describe the change and the reason. No `Co-Authored-By` trailers.
- PR template: check or uncheck items, never delete them.
- Add a library only when a feature needs it.
